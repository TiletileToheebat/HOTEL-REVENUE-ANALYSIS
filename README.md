# HOTEL-REVENUE-ANALYSIS

## Overview
This project analyzes hotel revenue data from 2018 to 2020 to evaluate annual growth and assess the necessity for parking lot expansion.

## Objectives
- Determine if hotel revenue is increasing each year.
- Assess whether the parking lot size needs to be expanded based on revenue contributions.

## Key Findings
- Hotel revenue grew from **$1.19M** in **2018** to **$5.49M** in **2019**, followed by a decline to **$3.51M** in **2020**.
- **City Hotel** contributed **53.62%** ($5.49M) of the total revenue, while **Resort Hotel** contributed **46.38%** ($4.75M).
- Parking lot revenue contributed only **2.36%** of total revenue from 2018 to 2020, suggesting that expanding the parking lot is unnecessary; optimization of existing spaces is recommended.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying the dataset.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.
